## Introduction

Welcome to the University Library System! This web application is designed to manage book inventories, user profiles, borrowing and wishlist functionalities, and more. Our platform provides a seamless and user-friendly experience for both users and administrators, ensuring efficient management of books and user data. Whether you are a book lover looking to manage your reading list or an admin trying to maintain a vast collection of books, this system caters to all your needs.

## Exception Handling

Our University Library System is built with robust exception handling mechanisms to ensure a smooth and error-free user experience. Below are some key areas where exception handling is implemented:

- **Sign Up and Log In**: Proper error messages are displayed if the user enters incorrect login credentials or attempts to sign up with already registered email addresses. Passwords must meet security requirements; otherwise, users will see: "Your password should be at least 8 characters long and include at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one special character (such as !@#$%^&*)."
- **Profile Management**: When editing profile details, the system checks for incorrect or incomplete data entries. Users are prompted to re-enter information if validation fails.
- **Borrow Books**: The system handles exceptions such as attempting to borrow a book that is already borrowed by another user or exceeding the borrowing limit.
- **Wishlist**: Users are notified if a book they attempt to add to their wishlist is already present.

## Frameworks and Technologies

### Backend
- **Django**: The primary web framework used for developing the backend of the application.

### Frontend
- **HTML/CSS**: Used for structuring and styling the web pages.
- **JavaScript**: Utilized for various interactive features including AJAX calls, dark mode toggling, and profile picture uploads.
